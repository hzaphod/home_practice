		<h1>Ferris is a cat. A grumpy old (but spry!) orange cat.</h1>
		
		<h2>A little bit about Ferris</h2>
			<p>I picked Ferris up from a pet shop in Milwaukie 14 years ago when he was just a kitten. I hadn't planned on adopting a kitten that day, and I already had a cat at home. But when I walked by his cage, all the other kittens were sleeping except for him, and he was reaching both paws out as far as he could towards me and meowing at the top of his little kitten lungs, and I knew he was coming home with me.</p>
		
		<h3>Here are some things that Ferris likes to do:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Sleep</li>
				<li>Eat</li>
				<li>Sleep</li>
				<li>Chase bugs</li>
				<li>Sleep some more on our laps</li>
				<li>Meow!</li>
			</ul>
